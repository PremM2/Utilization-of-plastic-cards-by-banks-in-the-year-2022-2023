# Utilization-of-plastic-cards-by-banks-in-the-year-2022-2023
While searching for a project, I came across bluetick.ai and decided to work on the Utilization of plastic cards by banks project for the period of 2022-2023. After understanding the issue, I collected data by web scraping the official website of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This provided me with 12 different files containing raw data. Upon examining the dataset, I addressed null values, created new columns using the power query editor, and removed irrelevant data that wasn't pertinent to the problem. Furthermore, I merged the 12 files into a single file for easier analysis.

For data visualization, I utilized Power BI, employing DAX queries to incorporate calculated measures and new columns required for the project. Data modeling was implemented to establish relationships with other data, and I utilized various visualization tools such as bar charts, pie charts, KPIs, and slicers to interact with the data.
